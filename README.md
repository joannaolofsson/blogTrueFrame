# blogTrueFrame

Hi, my name is Joanna and I've decided to create a blog about the areas where I can contribute. TrueFrame is about everything where human behavior, habits and where it meets tech. 
I have worked a long time as a CBT therapist. Then I'm making the transition to frontend development.
